# ECNG3006: Lab 3
This project is based off an example from the espressif ESP8266_RTOS_SDK (https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK). The 'gpio' example was used to conduct the required exercises. The project contains four branches, namely: master, unit-test, integration-test, verification-test.
